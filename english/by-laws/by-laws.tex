This is a translation of the Swedish version of the document. In case there's a difference between the English and Swedish versions, the Swedish version prevails.

This translation was written by Tove and Hugo, and is guided by the dictionary written by Talhenspresidiet/Speakers' Council '18

The English terms for meeting formalities in this document are mostly taken from ``Robert's Rules of Order, Newly Revised'', a book which includes the rules most commonly used in the U.S. when conducting meetings.
